# Evaluate an Essay with a Generative Model

This experiment determines the quality of essay evaluation by a generative model.

## Experiment Description

### Given

- Essay writing assignment.
- A set of essays written by different authors.
- A rubric for evaluating essays based on various criteria (e.g., content, structure, grammar).
- Scores assigned by a human expert for each essay.

### Task

1. Use a generative model to evaluate each essay based on the given criteria.
2. Evaluate each essay 100 times to obtain a distribution of scores.
3. Compare the scores assigned by the model with those assigned by the human expert using statistical methods (e.g., Pearson correlation, mean squared error).
4. Analyze the results and draw conclusions about the quality of the model's evaluation.
5. Suggest possible improvements to enhance the accuracy of the model's evaluation.

## Experiment Goals

Identify how well the generative model can evaluate essays compared to a human expert and determine areas for improvement.
