| `Base` class is defined                                                        |        |       |
| `Base` class has an integer field named `field`                                |        |       |
| `Base` class has a parameterized constructor that initializes `field`          |        |       |
| `Base` class has a method `ToString` that returns string value of `field`      |        |       |
| The method `ToString` is virtual                                               |        |       |
| `Derived` class is defined                                                     |        |       |
| `Derived` class inherits from `Base`                                           |        |       |
| `Derived` class has a parameterized constructor that sets the value of `field` |        |       |
| `Derived` class overrides `ToString` method                                    |        |       |
| Overridden `ToString` returns formatted string in pattern `field: <value>`     |        |       |
