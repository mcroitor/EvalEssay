# 14i001 Inheritance and Method Overriding in C++

Define a `Base` class with properties:

- an integer field named `field`;
- a parameterized constructor that sets the value of the `field`;
- a virtual method `ToString` that returns the string value of the `field`.

Define a `Derived` class that inherits from `Base` with properties:

- a parameterized constructor that sets the value of the `field`;
- an overridden `ToString` method that returns the value in the format `field: <field value>`, for example, for `field = 5` it returns `field: 5`.
