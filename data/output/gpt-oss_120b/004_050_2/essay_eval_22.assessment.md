| 1   | `ARG COMPOSER_VERSION=2.7`                                  | 10     | Correct declaration, but placed after the first FROM (order issue). |
| 2   | `FROM composer:${COMPOSER_VERSION} AS builder`              | 5      | FROM line present, but missing the `AS builder` alias. |

| 4   | `WORKDIR ${APP_DIR}`                                        | 8      | Uses `$APP_DIR` instead of `${APP_DIR}` (minor syntax deviation). |
| 5   | `COPY ./site/composer.json ${APP_DIR}`                      | 0      | Added invalid `--builder` flag and used `$APP_DIR/`; does not match required command. |

| 9   | `COPY --from=builder /composer/vendor /var/www/html/vendor` | 0      | Missing `--from=builder` and incorrect source path. |
