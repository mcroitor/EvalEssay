| 1   | `ARG COMPOSER_VERSION=2.7`                                  | 10     | Present but placed after the `FROM` line (should be before). |
| 2   | `FROM composer:${COMPOSER_VERSION} AS builder`              | 0      | Missing the `AS builder` alias. |

| 4   | `WORKDIR ${APP_DIR}`                                        | 10     | Uses `$APP_DIR` instead of `${APP_DIR}`; still valid. |
| 5   | `COPY ./site/composer.json ${APP_DIR}`                      | 0      | Invalid `--builder` flag and syntax deviates from required command. |

| 9   | `COPY --from=builder /composer/vendor /var/www/html/vendor` | 0      | Missing `--from=builder` and uses wrong source path. |

|     | **Total**                                                   | **66** | Deducted 4 points for misplaced `ARG` statements (‑2 each). |
