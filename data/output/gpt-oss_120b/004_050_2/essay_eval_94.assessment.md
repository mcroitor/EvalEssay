| 1   | `ARG COMPOSER_VERSION=2.7`                                  | 10     | Correct syntax, but placed after the FROM line (order issue). |
| 2   | `FROM composer:${COMPOSER_VERSION} AS builder`              | 0      | Missing the `AS builder` alias; command does not match required form. |

| 9   | `COPY --from=builder /composer/vendor /var/www/html/vendor` | 0      | Missing `--from=builder` and wrong source path. |
