| 1   | `ARG COMPOSER_VERSION=2.7`                                  | 10     | Correct value, but placed after the first FROM (order issue). |
| 2   | `FROM composer:${COMPOSER_VERSION} AS builder`              | 0      | Missing `AS builder` and appears before the ARG; command not satisfied. |

| 4   | `WORKDIR ${APP_DIR}`                                        | 8      | Uses `$APP_DIR` instead of `${APP_DIR}` (minor syntax deviation). |
| 5   | `COPY ./site/composer.json ${APP_DIR}`                      | 0      | Uses invalid `--builder` flag and incorrect syntax; does not match required command. |

| 9   | `COPY --from=builder /composer/vendor /var/www/html/vendor` | 0      | Missing `--from=builder` and wrong source path. |
| 10  | `COPY ./site/ /var/www/html/`                               | 0      | Copies entire context (`.`) instead of `./site/`. |
|     | **Total**                                                   | **68** | Order penalties: 4 misplaced commands × 2 pts = **‑8** points. Final score **60/100**. |
